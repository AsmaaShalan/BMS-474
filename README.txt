# Heart Failure Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict heart failure using machine learning models. It includes two datasets, preprocessing steps, and the training of various models.

## Data
- Two datasets: heart1_304.csv and heart2_919.csv
- Data preprocessing steps included

## Models
- RandomForest, XGBoost,Gradient Boost, SVM, and Stacking models

## Usage
- Run the Jupyter notebook or Python script to execute the code.

## Files
- `heart1_304.csv`: First dataset with 304 records.
- `heart2_919.csv`: Second dataset with 919 records.
- `ML_Project.ipynb`: Main code file.
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies file.

## Model Evaluation
- Feature importance plots.
- Meta-model accuracy on different datasets.
